# Performance #

Some reference performance numbers. All using a 1 CPU for processing, for high throughputs multiple CPUs can be used, typically filtering by multicast group number

## CME ##

About 2.5Gbps per 1 CPU throughput 


## EUREX
About 0.9Gbps per 1 CPU throughput

## NASDAQ
About 0.7Gbps per 1 CPU Throughput

## SIAC CTS
SIAC CTS Feed 1.0 Gbps per 1 CPU throughput

## SIAC OPRA

SIAC OPRA Full A/B feed all running on a single 1 CPU. 0.4Gbps. Performance can be improved substantially by distributing the multicast groups to multiple CPUs
